        Hey there, folks! I'm Galuh, the magnificent bug creator and self-proclaimed software sorcerer.
        They say I write software for fun, but truth be told, those pesky bugs seem to have a blast at my expense!
    </p>

    <p>
        When I'm not busy conjuring up bugs, I'm a tech enthusiast exploring a wide range of fascinating realms.
        Whether it's diving into the depths of embedded Linux, creating captivating computer graphics,
        or tinkering with incredible IoT wonders, I'm like a kid in a candy store.
        But wait, there's more to my repertoire! I've also dabbled in the magical arts of backend, frontend, and UI/UX.
        I guess you can call me a coding chameleon, adapting to whatever tech challenge comes my way.
    </p>

    <p>
        Right now, I'm on an exciting learning journey, delving into the enchanting worlds of Rust and ML.
        Bugs, brace yourselves because I'm armed with new skills, and I'm ready to take our relationship to the next level!
    </p>

        If you're a recruiter on the prowl for top talent, you can find me eagerly waiting on <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/galuhutama">LinkedIn</a>.
        Calling all fellow coding enthusiasts, join me on <a href="https://github.com/gwutama">GitHub</a> for bug-infested coding escapades.
        And for those daring souls in search of an influencer to collaborate with, my <a href="https://instagram.com/gwutama">Instagram</a> is the place to be.
    </p>

    <p>
        But wait, there's more to me than just coding prowess! Picture this: me, pedaling away on my bike,
        surrounded by buzzing bugs, as if I have my own entourage. It's like a bug parade on wheels!
        And did you know that I'm an <a href="https://instagram.com/gwutama">amateur nature photographer</a>? Bugs may photo bomb my shots,
        but hey, it adds a whimsical touch to the captures!
    </p>

    <p>
        Now, here's a claim that might raise an eyebrow or two: I can rock the guitar like a superstar.
        You'll just have to take my word for it and let your imagination run wild with bug-infused melodies.
    </p>

    <p>
        In the kitchen, I embark on daring culinary adventures, crafting pasta dishes that are both edible and, according to my toughest critic,
        my daughter, worthy of a 5 out of 7 rating. Move over, celebrity chefs &mdash; I'm here to make bugs and taste buds dance!
    </p>

    <p>
        And fear not, dear friends, this page is dressed to impress! No missing stylesheets here, just like there are no bugs missing from my coding escapades!
